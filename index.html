    <p>Dr. Qiu received the Ph.D degree in Chemical Engineering from Northeastern University. She worked with <a
            href="https://www.nanopcm.com/">Prof. Su</a>
        in
        the
        Su Nanomaterials and Nanomedicine Group. Before that she received her master degree in the Department of
        chemistry
        and
        chemical biology department, Northeastern University, USA, in Jan. 2015, Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering from
        School of
        Chemistry, Bachelor’s Degree in Actuarial Sciences from College of Mathematics, Jilin University, China, in Jul.
        2013.
        From August. 2014, she was working with her Ph.D. advisor Prof. Su on Nanoparticle focused/enhanced X-ray
        radiation
        therapy , Precision medicines with 3D microtissue and Single cell array based DNA damage assay, and Multiplexed
        biomarker detection, Northeastern University, Boston, MA. Dr. Qiu also received Master of Public Health from
        Harvard
        School of Public Health in May 2018 and earned Master of Fine Arts from Berklee College of Music Dec. 2019. She
        has
        successfully finished several internships/coops in Harvard Medical School and pharmaceutical companies including
        Catabasis in Cambridge, MA. She was a visiting student (Jan. 2010 ~ Jan. 2011) in School of Material Science and
        Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.</p>
