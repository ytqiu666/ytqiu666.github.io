<h1 id="biography">Biography</h1>
<p>Dr. Qiu received the Ph.D degree in Chemical Engineering from Northeastern University. She worked with <a href="https://www.nanopcm.com/">Prof. Su</a> in the Su Nanomaterials and Nanomedicine Group. Before that she received her master degree in the Department of chemistry and chemical biology department, Northeastern University, USA, in Jan. 2015, Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering from School of Chemistry, Bachelor’s Degree in Actuarial Sciences from College of Mathematics, Jilin University, China, in Jul. 2013. From August. 2014, she was working with my PhD advisor Prof. Su on Nanoparticle focused/enhanced X-ray radiation therapy , Precision medicines with 3D microtissue andSingle cell array based DNA damage assay, and Multiplexed biomarker detection, Northeastern University. She was a visiting student (Jan. 2010 ~ Jan. 2011) in School of Material Scienceand Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.</p>
